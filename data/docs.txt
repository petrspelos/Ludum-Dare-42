Welcome to WinDOORS! 😁

You are on a computer running a rather old build of WinDOORS OS. Lucky for you, the computer is currently installing a newer build for you. However, it seems that you do not have enough disk space to download the whole update! You must act quickly before you have a hard drive failure.

🚩 The goal 🚩
Your goal is to clear up as much memory as you can before the disk space reaches 0.

❓ How to play ❓
• Install new applications to assist you in clearing disk space by browsing the App Store.

• Every file takes disk space (including this file). Browse files with the File Explorer and uninstall files by (right clicking them and hitting uninstall?)

• Open applications and files by left-clicking them on your desktop.
