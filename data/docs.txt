Welcome to WinDOORS! 😁

You are on a computer running a rather old build of WinDOORS OS. Lucky for you, the computer is currently installing a newer build for you. However, it seems that you do not have enough disk space to download the whole update! You must act quickly before you have a hard drive failure.


🚩 The goal 🚩
Your goal is to clear up as much memory as you can before the disk space reaches 0. 
Try to survive as long as possible, and most importantly, have fun!


❓ What can I do ❓

• Open applications by left-clicking them on your desktop.

• Remove files from the thrash bin to clear up some space.

• Uninstall big applications by clicking System Settings > Uninstall Applications. Choose which apps to uninstall wisely, as you may need them in the future, and re-installing can take a lot of time.

• Install new applications from the App Store to assist you in clearing disk space.

• Remove viruses by scanning with the VirusButcher.

• Hunt for achievements


ℹ Other information ℹ

For the best experience, play with audio enabled.

Try out all the applications! Most of them are not as useless as you would think!
